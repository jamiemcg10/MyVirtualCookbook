### Using the cookbook

Once you create an account, you can add recipes and chapters to your cookbook using the _Add Chapter_ and _Add Recipe_ buttons at the top of the screen. Recipes can be added to an existing chapter or to a new chapter, but each recipe must belong to a chapter.

Chapters can be expanded or collapsed by clicking them. Clicking a chapter's trash icon will delete that chapter. Clicking the edit icon by the chapter name will let you edit the name of the chapter. You can drag and drop chapters to reorder them.

Each recipe has a menu with options to edit or delete that recipe. The name and the link for the recipe can be edited. You can drag and drop recipes to re-order them within the chapter and also to move them into other chapters.

### Viewing recipes and recipe notes

Recipes can be opened by clicking on their titles. When a recipe is expanded, a box is shown where you can view or edit notes for that recipe.
