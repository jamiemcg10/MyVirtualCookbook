MyVirtualCookbook

This app allows users to collect and organize recipe bookmarks online. New users must first create an account. Users can register using an email address and password or by linking with their Google or Facebook accounts. 

Once an account has been created, users can add recipes and chapters to their cookbook using the Add Recipe and Add Chapter buttons at the bottom of the screen. When adding a recipe, users can choose to add it to an existing chapter or to add it to a new chapter. Recipes can be moved between chapters by dragging them from one chapter to another. Right-clicking a chapter or recipe brings up a menu with options to rename or delete that recipe or chapter.

Next to each recipe is an icon for notes. When this icon is clicked, a box will appear underneath the recipe where users can see or edit notes for that recipe. Clicking the icon again will hide the notes box. Recipes can be opened by clicking on them. There are two types of recipe pages. 

Recipes that are underlined will open in a new tab and will have a separate window pop up with the notes for that recipe. 
Recipes that are not underlined will open in a new tab and will have the notes in a pane on the side.

Notes can only be edited in one place at a time, so if a recipe is open, you can't edit notes in the table of contents.
