### Using the Virtual Cookbook
Once an account has been created, you can add recipes and chapters to your cookbook using the *Add Recipe* and *Add Chapter* buttons at the bottom of the screen. Recipes can be added to an existing chapter or to a new chapter. Each recipe must belong to a chapter. Chapters can be opened or closed by clicking them. Recipes can be moved between chapters by dragging them from one chapter to another. Right-clicking a chapter or recipe brings up a menu with options to rename or delete that recipe or chapter.

### Viewing Recipes and Recipe Notes
Next to each recipe is an icon for notes. When this icon is clicked, a box will appear underneath the recipe where users can view or edit notes for that recipe. Changes to notes save automatically. Clicking the icon again will hide the notes box. Recipes can be opened by clicking on their titles. There are two types of recipe pages. 

- Recipes that are underlined will open in a new tab with a separate pop-up window with the notes for that recipe. 
- Recipes that are not underlined will open in a new tab and will have the notes in a pane on the side of the page.

Notes can only be edited in one place at a time, so if a recipe is open, you can't edit notes in the table of contents.
